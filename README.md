## Alice & Red Queen - Animation

This animation is created using Web Animation API and React Hooks. This was achieved by the [Use-Web-Animation](https://github.com/wellyshen/use-web-animations) library, which exposes the `useWebAnimations` hook that provides plenty of functions, properties and events to develop highly-performant and lightweight animations.

When you click / tap, it urges Alice and the Red Queen to speed up. The background elements also have playback rates that are adjusted in response to your click / tap.

Alice & Red Queen - Animation is available on *Surge* [at this link](http://queen-race.surge.sh/)
